# lfe-ls

*LFE Language Server implementation*

Tested with Erlang 25-27.

## About [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

LFE language server written in LFE.

I started this project because I wanted to try LFE in a real project and LFE has a bit of a lack of tooling.  
It is largely work in progress. The following LSP functionality is implemented:

- `initialize` request/response
- `initialized` notification
- `textDocument/didOpen` notification which loads and maintains documents in memory.
- `textDocument/didChange` notification which updates the document in memory. Currently the sync transfers the full document. There is room form optimization here to implement a incremental sync.
- `textDocument/didClose` notification which deletes the document in memory.
- `textDocument/didSave` notification
- `textDocument/completion` request/response implements global symbols and loaded modules as well as module functions.
- `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification to push compile diagnostics on saving a file.
- `textDocument/hover` request/response that shows module/function documentation

`didOpen` and `didSave` will compile the source file on the server to provide diagnostics to the client.
However, this does not replace the `C-c-k` key sequence to compile the and reload the module in the REPL in order to take the changes into effect.

Planned further support is:

- showing signature support for functions

Auto-completion is rudimentary right now. It completes global symbols/atoms, functions/macros and functions on a module basis by parsing the text and looking for ':' character which indicates completing for a module.
There is a lot of room for improvement. I.e.: functions within a module could be parsed from the text, or variables within a let.

### Emacs lfe-mode tweaks

To allow Emacs with Eglot (or also lsp-mode) to trigger completion on `:` character one has to tweak the lfe-mode to change `lfe-mode-syntax-table` and set `:` to be a punctuation character. Here is the full function (found in lfe-mode.el):

```lisp
(defvar lfe-mode-syntax-table
  (let ((table (copy-syntax-table lisp-mode-syntax-table)))
    ;; Like scheme we allow [ ... ] as alternate parentheses.
    (modify-syntax-entry ?\[ "(]  " table)
    (modify-syntax-entry ?\] ")[  " table)
    ;; ":" character should be used as punctuation to separate symbols
    (modify-syntax-entry ?: "." table)
    table)
  "Syntax table in use in Lisp Flavoured Erlang mode buffers.")
```

### Support for ltest

`lfe-ls` automatically adds `_build/test/lib` as include to the compiler.
So if ltest is added as a test dependency then its includes like: 

```lisp
(include-lib "ltest/include/ltest-macros.lfe")
```

will automatically be found.

### Project support

In order to allow lfe-ls to work with a workspace folder it is a must to create a **git repository** in the folder your are operating. That will Emacs to recognize the folder as a project.

## Build [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Compile with:

```shell
$ rebar3 lfe compile
```

To create a release do:

```shell
$ rebar3 as prod do clean,release,escriptize
```

An executable can be started as `_build/prod/bin/lfe-ls`.

## Eglot for Emacs:

To add lfe-ls as a server in Eglot the following can be added to the Eglot config:

```
(add-to-list
   'eglot-server-programs
   '(lfe-mode . ("/path/to/lfe-ls/_build/prod/bin/lfe-ls"
                 "--transport" "tcp" "--port" :autoport)))
```

# Start the Project REPL [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

```shell
$ rebar3 lfe repl
```

Starting the repl in this way wilkl automatically start the lfe-ls application and ls server.

# Tests [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

```shell
$ rebar3 as test eunit
```
